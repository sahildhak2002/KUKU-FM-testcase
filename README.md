# KUKU-FM-testcase
✅ Detailed Test Case Descriptions:
1. Website Launch on URL Hit (TC_001):
Description: This test verifies that the Kuku FM website loads properly when the correct URL (https://kukufm.com) is entered in the browser. The goal is to ensure the server is responding and the home page renders without any issues such as errors, broken layout, or loading delays.

2. Search Bar Functionality (TC_002):
Description: This test checks whether the search bar located on the home page functions correctly. Keywords like "audiobook" and "stories" are entered to see if the search results match the expected content. It ensures the search mechanism is active and fetching relevant results from the backend.

3. CTA (Call-To-Action) Buttons Visibility (TC_003):
Description: This case ensures that all major CTA buttons (e.g., "Listen Now", "Subscribe", "Start Free Trial") are clearly visible on the home page and other major landing pages. The goal is to confirm that CTAs are not hidden, overlapping, or broken, as they are key to user engagement and conversion.

4. Social Media Links in Footer (TC_004):
Description: This test ensures that social media icons like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, YouTube, etc., are present in the website’s footer section. Each link is clicked to verify it redirects correctly to the official social media pages of Kuku FM in a new tab.

5. Login/Signup Wrong Credential Validation (TC_005):
Description: This test checks the login and sign-up forms for proper validation against incorrect credentials. The tester inputs invalid email/phone number or wrong passwords and expects the system to reject them with proper error messages. This ensures authentication security is functioning properly.

6. Language Change Feature (TC_006):
Description: This test validates the functionality of changing languages (e.g., from Hindi to English and vice versa). The tester selects a different language from the dropdown or toggle option, and checks if the website content updates accordingly without breaking layout or navigation.

7. Navigation Link Functionality (TC_007):
Description: This test case verifies that all primary navigation options (e.g., Home, Explore, Library, My Subscriptions, Premium, etc.) are working as intended. Each link should redirect the user to the correct section or page without errors or misrouting.

8. Placeholder Text in Search and Forms (TC_008):
Description: This test ensures that placeholder text is present and meaningful in the search bar (e.g., "Search Audiobooks...") and in login/sign-up form fields (e.g., "Enter email", "Enter password"). Placeholders help improve the user experience by indicating the expected input format.
